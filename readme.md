### Packages used:
1. `opencv-contrib-python`
2. `numpy`
3. `os`

This script is uses on **Haar Cascade method** for face detection and uses **Local Binary Pattern Histogram method** (`LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()`) function to recognise the face and label it.

## Further Improvements:

1. Can be used in Video analysis
2. ...
